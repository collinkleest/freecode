# arrays and hashing

`contains-duplicate.py`
- there are multiple ways of solving this problem but the best way is to use a set or a hashmap
- the set/map is used to track the numbers that have been found in the array
- when we encounter a number that is already in the set/map we return True
- if we encounter a number that is not in the set/map we add it in the set
